# Front matter

If you have a Jekyll page that doesn't have a title specified in the YAML Front Matter, but the first non-whitespace line in the page is a Markdown H1/H2/H3, [this plugin](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-titles-from-headings) instructs Jekyll to use that first heading as the page's title.

If you have a readme file, and your site doesn't otherwise have an index file, [this plugin](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-readme-index) instructs Jekyll to use the readme as the site's index. That's it. No more, no less.

```tip
All of the github pages features is supported
